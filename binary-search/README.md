# Binary search

## Time complexity

O(log n)

## Exercises

1. Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of steps it would take?

You would only require a maximum of 7 steps as `O(128) = 7`.

2. Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum number of steps now?

You would only require a maximum of 8 steps as `O(256) = 8`.
