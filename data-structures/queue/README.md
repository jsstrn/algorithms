# Queue

A queue follows a first in first out policy.

| Operation        | Linked-list | Array |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Enqueue (insert) | O(1)        | O(n)  |
| Dequeue (delete) | O(1)        | O(n)  |

Given that linked-lists have better performance than arrays, we can implement the queue data structure with a linked-list.
