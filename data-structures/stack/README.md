# Stack

A stack data structure follows a last in first out (LIFO) policy.

| Operations    | Linked-list | Array |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Push (insert) | O(1)        | O(n)  |
| Pop (delete)  | O(1)        | O(n)  |

Given that linked-lists have better performance than arrays, we can implement the stack data structure with a linked-list.
